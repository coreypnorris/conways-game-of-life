##Conway's game of life

####This is a ruby method for [Conway's game of life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

This method isn't quite working yet and is in need of some refactoring. However, you're still able to use it if you would like to. To use it, download the zip file and navigate to the file in your terminal. Then run `conway.rb` to bring up the user interface.

We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). This exercise was meant to stretch the limits of our Ruby understanding and skills.
